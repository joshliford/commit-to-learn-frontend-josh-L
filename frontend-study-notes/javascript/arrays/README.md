# Arrays

Arrays are objects that store ordered collections of data and come with powerful built-in methods.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
- Zero-based indexing (first item = index 0).
- Arrays can hold any type (numbers, strings, objects, functions).
- Often used with loops and iteration methods.

## ðŸš€ Common Methods
- **push / pop** â€“ add/remove at the end
- **shift / unshift** â€“ add/remove at the start
- **map** â€“ create a new array by transforming each element
- **filter** â€“ create a new array with items that pass a condition
- **reduce** â€“ boil an array down to a single value
- **find** â€“ return the first element that matches
- **forEach** â€“ loop through each item (no return)
