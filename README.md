A living notebook of my Web Dev journey. Part study guide &amp; part playground.

# Web Dev Study Notes

This repository is my ongoing study space for learning **frontend development**.  
It serves as both a personal study guide and a reference notebook. Each topic is organized into its own folder with subfolders/files for practice code and notes.

## 📝 Learning Flow

1. **JavaScript** → Core language fundamentals: variables, functions, arrays, objects, classes.  
2. **HTML** → Structure of webpages, semantic elements, forms, and accessibility.  
3. **CSS** → Styling webpages: selectors, layouts (flexbox, grid), responsive design.  
4. **DOM (Document Object Model)** → Connecting JavaScript to HTML: events, element selection, and manipulation.  
5. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** → A lightweight data format for sending and receiving structured data.  
6. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** → Using `fetch` to send HTTP requests (GET, POST) and work with external data.  
7. **React** → A JavaScript library for building reusable UI components with JSX, props, and state.

## 🚀 Goals
- Reinforce fundamentals with **hands-on practice code**.  
- Organize notes by topic for **easy review and reference**.  
- Build a clear progression that mirrors my **frontend learning journey**.
